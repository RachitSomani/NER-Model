# Named Entity Recognition (NER) on Legal Text in Hindi

## Overview

In my recent project, I focused on enhancing the analysis of Hindi legal text through Named Entity Recognition (NER). Leveraging Python, Transformers, and the Hugging Face library, I fine-tuned the MuRIL (Multilingual Representations for Indian Languages) model. The outcome was an impressive accuracy of 90.16%.

## Key Achievements

- **MuRIL Model Fine-Tuning:**
  - Achieved a high accuracy of 90.16% by fine-tuning the MuRIL model, specifically designed for multilingual representations in Indian languages.

- **Data Collection and Transformation:**
  - Collected, converted, and transformed over 100 Judicial Reports using Image-to-text conversion tools to prepare a comprehensive dataset.

- **Manual Annotation:**
  - Annotated more than 3000 data lines manually using various tools, including the NER Text Annotator Tool, to ensure precise and accurate training data.

## Dataset Source

The dataset utilized in this project was sourced from the Rajasthan Judicial website. For detailed information about the dataset, refer to the [project repository](https://github.com/Chitransh-Jaiswal/NER-Model/blob/main/README.md).
